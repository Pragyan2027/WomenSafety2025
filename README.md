1. **Allow Microphone Access:** The system listens for high-pitch scream frequencies.  
2. **Detection:** Once a scream or loud noise is detected, the system triggers an alert.  
3. **Emergency Response:** SOS and panic alarms are activated instantly.  
4. **Face Recognition:** Confirms identity and helps avoid false alerts.  
5. **Daily Check-in:** Ensures user safety through scheduled prompts.
